// The kind of worklet it is
registerDemoWorklet('name', class { // The name we'll call this worklet

  // Each worklet can define different functions to be used
  // These will be called by the render engine as needed
  process(arg) {
    // Stuff happens in here! What happens depends on the worklet
    // Sometimes it'll return something
    // Other times it'll work directly on the arguments
    return !arg;
  }
});

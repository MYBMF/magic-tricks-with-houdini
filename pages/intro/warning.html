  Some of Houdini is pretty stable and getting cross-browser implementations,
  some is still quite a bit away from being usable, and the landscape is
  currently in flux with Edge moving to Chromium. Most of what we're going to
  talk about today are the mostly stable bits, but you're going to need to use
  polyfills and get your progressive enhancement on in order to use this stuff
  today.

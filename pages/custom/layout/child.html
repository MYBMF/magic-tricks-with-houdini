  * Doesn't contain any layout information itself, but can be used to generate `fragment`s which do

  * Has computed styles that can be accessed by `styleMap` (from the Typed OM)

  * Can be generated by an element, a root inline box, `::before`, `::after`, or anonymous boxes (like blockified text nodes or `display: table-cell` elements without a parent table)

  * All children of a current box get passed as an array of `Layout Child`ren to the layout method

  * Calling `layoutNextFragment`will generate a fragment from a `LayoutChild`

state: theme
notes: >
  One of the first big things I made with the Paint API was some background themes for a slide deck I was building. Here, we're doing something with Custom Properties and the Paint API that goes beyond what's currently possible with CSS Variables alone. We've got a pair of custom idents that, when changed, actually change what gets displayed!

  The `--theme-color` property is especially interesting for me, as we're not actually taking a `<color>` but rather taking an ident that _looks_ like a color. The Paint worklet takes it in and figured out what actual colors to use; the user just picks what theme color they'd like!

    initial: blue;
  }

  @property --theme-background-type {
    syntax: 'footer|divider';

    initial: divider;
  }
}</code></pre>

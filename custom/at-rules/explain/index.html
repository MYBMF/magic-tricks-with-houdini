<p>So, I have one good use-case for creating custom at-rules: <a href="https://github.com/Snugug/eq.js">Element Queries</a>. It's very unlikely we'll get them natively, for a large variety of reasons, but custom at-rules will let us have them at native CSS Engine speed. In theory. Other use cases, <em>and I'm speculating here</em>, could include porting CSS Preprocessor goodies like control directives, mixins, and extends to CSS.</p>

<h2 class="blink">WARNING</h2> <p>This <em>literally</em> doesn't have a spec yet. You'll find some mention of custom at-rules here and there, but no one's gotten around to actually writing out the draft proposal yet. This is entirely based on a conversation and some sample code that Tab Atkins wrote for me at SassConf 2015. I've updated the sample code based on what the current specs look like, so it's just as likely to be correct as not. <strong>You Have Been Warned</strong>.</p>

<h3>Not Quite</h3>

<ul class="fragment">
  <li>It's currently not possible to <em>extend</em> CSS with JS, only write JS that mimics CSS</li>
  <li class="fragment">Actually polyfilling CSS, or introducing new features (like CSS Grids), is hard-to-impossible to do. Doubly so in a way that's not terrible for performance.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Houdini will let authors <em>tap in to the actual CSS engine</em>, finally allowing them to extend CSS, and do so at CSS Engine speeds</li>
